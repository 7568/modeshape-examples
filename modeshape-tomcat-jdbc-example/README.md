Example Using ModeShape from a JSF application persisting data in a Database
============================================================================

What is it?
-----------

This is a self-contained and deployable Maven 3 project that shows how to get access and use a repository from
a JSF 2 application while storing the data in a Database.

System requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this project is Java 7.0 (Java SDK 1.7) or better, Maven 3.0 or better.
The application this project produces is designed to be run on Tomcat 7.x or greater.

Build and Deploy the Example automatically via Maven
-----------------------------------------------------
_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must use the `settings.xml`
file from the root of this project. See [this ModeShape community article](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ModeShapeandMaven)
for help on how to install and configure Maven 3._

This project is self-contained and can be built at the top level of your local clone of the Git repository, or by simply building this project
using Maven 3.

1. Type this command to build & deploy the archive:

        mvn clean package cargo:run

2. This will produce a WAR file named `target/modeshape-tomcat-jdbc-example.war`, download a Tomcat 7.x instance (via the Maven Cargo plugin),
deploy & start this web application in the Tomcat instance

Build and Deploy the Example manually into an existing Tomcat instance
----------------------------------------------------------------------
_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must use the `settings.xml`
file from the root of this project. See [this ModeShape community article](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ModeShapeandMaven)
for help on how to install and configure Maven 3._

This project is self-contained and can be built at the top level of your local clone of the Git repository, or by simply building this project
using Maven 3.

1. Type this command to build the archive:

        mvn clean package

2. This will produce a WAR file named `target/modeshape-tomcat-jdbc-example.war`
3. Copy the above WAR into your local `%TOMCAT_HOME%/webapps` folder
4. Start the Tomcat server

Change the database in which the application stores its data
-------------------------------------------------------------
The application build system contains 3 build profiles:

1. default_dbms (active by default if no other explicit profile is given) - Stores the data in a H2 File database.
2. mysql5 - Stores the data in a MySQL 5 database
3. postgresql9 - Stores the data in a PostgresSQL 9 instance

If you want to change the database used for storing content, you can:

1. Change the contents of the `pom.xml` file making sure you specify your DB connection properties (url, username and password)
2. Pass the profile name to Maven when building the application. For example:

   mvn clean package cargo:run -Pmysql5

Accessing the application
-------------------------

The application will be running by default at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/modeshape-tomcat-jdbc-example/>.
The user is presented with a form where he can input one of the following:

1. Number of folders (n)
2. Number of files (m)

based on which the application will create n (folders) X m (files), each file with a certain binary content.

The ModeShape project
---------------------
ModeShape is an open source implementation of the JCR 2.0 
([JSR-283](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283])) specification and 
standard API. To your applications, ModeShape looks and behaves like a 
regular JCR repository. Applications can search, query, navigate, change, 
version, listen for changes, etc. But ModeShape can store that content 
in a variety of back-end stores (including relational databases, Infinispan 
data grids, JBoss Cache, etc.), or it can access and update existing content 
from *other* kinds of systems (including file systems, SVN repositories, 
JDBC database metadata, and other JCR repositories). ModeShape's connector 
architecture means that you can write custom connectors to access any 
kind of system. And ModeShape can even federate multiple back-end systems 
into a single, unified virtual repository.
